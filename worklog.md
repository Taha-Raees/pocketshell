# PocketShell — Multi-Agent Work Log

Shared, append-only log. Each agent: read first, append after finishing a task.

---
Task ID: 0
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: M0 — inspect repo/environment, research ecosystem, produce architecture docs.

Work Log:
- Inspected repository: greenfield (only .gitignore [skills/, node_modules/], .env [DATABASE_URL], empty download/ upload/ skills/). Nothing Android-related existed. No deletions performed.
- Verified network (GitHub + Maven reachable), Java 21 present; installed Gradle 8.14.5 to /home/z/tools.
- Installed Android SDK (cmdline-tools → /home/z/android-sdk): platform-tools, platforms;android-36, build-tools;36.0.0, ndk;28.2.13676358 (r28c, 16KB default alignment). Licenses accepted.
- Verified latest stable versions live: Gradle 9.7.1 / AGP 8.13.2 / Kotlin 2.4.20 / Compose BOM 2025.12.01 / Activity 1.10.1 / Lifecycle 2.9.4; chose conservative pairing AGP 8.13.2 + Gradle 8.14.5 + compileSdk 36 (API 37 still beta).
- Cloned termux-app to /home/z/tools/upstream/termux-app (shallow, depth 50). HEAD = 3b66f8799635a4dba4a206563048ff0e6792c487 (2026-08-24). AUDIT: terminal-emulator + terminal-view are self-contained (zero termux.shared imports), deps = androidx.annotation only, JNI via ndk-build (termux.c: createSubprocess/setPtyWindowSize/setPtyUTF8Mode/waitFor/close), 19 upstream JVM test classes, LICENSE GPLv3-only (jackpal Apache-2.0 lineage noted upstream).
- Decisions D1–D4 recorded (vendor Termux modules at pinned commit; reuse PTY JNI; M1 shell = /system/bin/sh + toybox; keyboard → synthetic KeyEvents + KeyboardState → upstream readCtrl/Alt/Shift/FnKey hooks).
- Wrote README.md, docs/{RESEARCH,ARCHITECTURE,THIRD_PARTY,ROADMAP,TESTING,CHANGELOG}.md. Appended Android ignores to .gitignore (existing lines preserved). .env untouched.

Stage Summary:
- Toolchain pinned: Gradle 8.14.5, AGP 8.13.2, Kotlin 2.4.20, platform 36, build-tools 36.0.0, NDK 28.2.13676358.
- Upstream pin: termux-app 3b66f8799635a4dba4a206563048ff0e6792c487, GPLv3 → PocketShell GPLv3.
- Key integration hooks: TerminalSessionClient, TerminalViewClient(readControlKey/readAltKey/readShiftKey/readFnKey/onScale), KeyHandler.getCode.
- Constraint documented for M2: targetSdk>=29 blocks exec from app-writable storage (W^X); Termux upstream targets SDK 28 for this reason; M1 unaffected (/system/bin/sh is a system binary).
- Sandbox has no device/emulator: manual on-device acceptance stays a mandatory human step (TESTING.md).
